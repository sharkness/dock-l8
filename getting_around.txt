## Navigating development with docker

- Running commands on your laravel container:
    Our laravel container is named `myl8app`, per the docker-compose file. 
    Commands can be run by invoking `docker-compose exec myl8app` + the service and the command you wish to run.

    like so:

    `docker-compose exec myl8app php artisan migrate`
    or
    `docker-compose exec myl8app composer require spatie/yaml-front-matter`

- Access your database:
Our database is named `mariadb`, per the docker-compose file. To get on the db, run the following in your terminal:

`docker-compose exec mariadb mysql -uroot -p`
